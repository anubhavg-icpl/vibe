description: Describes the concise SendUserMessage tool variant for sending verbatim user-visible messages with normal or proactive status
ccVersion: 2.1.173
-->
Send a message the user will read verbatim. Use this for content they need to see exactly as written between tool calls — a generated code snippet, a specific value, a direct reply to something they asked mid-task. Don't use it for routine narration of what you're about to do, or for your final answer — normal text reaches them for those.

`status`: 'normal' when replying to what they just asked; 'proactive' when you're surfacing something unprompted.
